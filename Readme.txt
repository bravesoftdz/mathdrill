Oasis Digital Math Drill

This is simple software to help grade-school students practice
basic arithmetic facts. I created it for my own kids, so it has
just the base minimum features needed at the moment.

Documentation is in the file "Math Drill Documentation.odt",
an OpenOffice file.  (see openoffice.org)

This is a Win32 application, compiled with Delphi 2007.

This is free software, see license.txt.

Enjoy. I'd love to hear if anyone finds this useful.
